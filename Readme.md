# Miyoo Flip Hardware Profiler

A lightweight hardware profiling script designed for the Miyoo Flip console to monitor CPU, GPU, RAM, and power metrics in real time. This tool is useful for performance analysis, debugging, and optimizing your handheld experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks CPU frequency, GPU load, RAM usage, and battery metrics.
- **Comprehensive Logs**: Automatically generates logs with timestamps.
- **Customizable**: Adjust parameters like log location and rotation size.
- **Minimal Impact**: Designed to run in the background with minimal resource usage.

## Prerequisites

1. A Miyoo Flip console.
2. Access to an SD card reader for transferring files.
3. Basic knowledge of handling Linux-based systems.

## Installation

### Step 1: Transfer the Script

1. Download the script from this repository:
   - [Download hardware_profiler.sh](./hardware_profiler.sh)
2. Insert your Miyoo Flipâ€™s SD card into your PC. Alternatively, use USB Mass Storage mode to access the SD card.
3. Copy the `hardware_profiler.sh` script to the following location:
   - **Path**: `/mnt/sdcard/app/miyoo355/`

---

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

1. Insert the SD card back into the Miyoo Flip.
2. Connect the Miyoo Flip to your PC using **USB Mass Storage** mode.
3. Navigate to the script and press A. You'll get two options in chinese. The first one is to view the file, and the second one is to execute it.
	Choose the second one.
4. The Miyoo will kick you out of the file commander app and the profiler will be running in the background. Whenever you want to view the logfile,
	just navigate back to /mnt/sdcard/app/miyoo355/` and it will be inside the `/profiler_logs` folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. No logs are generated:
	-Ensure the script is executable.
	-Check that the log directory exists and has write permissions.
2. Metrics are missing or inaccurate:
	-Verify the profiler paths inside the script.
	-Ensure the correct firmware is installed.
3. No Tracking currently for SOC metrics
   -The script is not equipped to track SOC runtime metrics.
   - The correct filepath is still unknown.
