1. Download the script from this repository:
   - [Download hardware_profiler.sh](./hardware_profiler.sh)
2. Insert your Miyoo Flipâ€™s SD card into your PC. Alternatively, use USB Mass Storage mode to access the SD card.

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

1. Insert the SD card back into the Miyoo Flip.
2. Connect the Miyoo Flip to your PC using **USB Mass Storage** mode.
3. Navigate to the script and press A. You'll get two options in chinese. The first one is to view the file, and the second one is to execute it.
	Choose the second one.
4. The Miyoo will kick you out of the file commander app and the profiler will be running in the background. Whenever you want to view the logfile,
	just navigate back to /mnt/sdcard/app/miyoo355/` and it will be inside the `/profiler_logs` folder.
